<p>The <i>Warfare</i> strategy card allows a player to remove a command token from the board and redistribute their command tokens between their tactic, fleet, and strategy pools. This card&rsquo;s initiative value is &ldquo;6&rdquo;. During the action phase, if the active player has the <i>Warfare</i> strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card&rsquo;s primary ability.</p>
<p>To resolve the primary ability on the <i>Warfare</i> strategy card, the active player performs the following steps:</p>
    <ol class="lrr">
    <li><b>Step 1</b>: The active player removes any one of their command tokens from the game board. Then, that player gains that command token by placing it in a pool of their choice on their command sheet.</li>
    <li><b>Step 2</b>: The active player can redistribute their command tokens.</li>
    <li>After the active player resolves the primary ability of the <i>Warfare</i> strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from their strategy pool to resolve the <sc>Production</sc> ability of one space dock in their home system.</li>
    <ol><li>The command token is <b>not</b> placed in their home system.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Notes</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the player with <i>Warfare</i> has no command tokens on the game board, they may still perform a strategic action. However, they will not gain a command token.</li>
    </ol>
