<p>Initiative order is the order in which players resolve steps of the action and status phases.</p>
    <ol class="lrr">
	<li>Initiative order is determined by the initiative numbers on strategy cards.</li>
    <ol><li>A player who has the Naalu &ldquo;0&rdquo; token has the initiative number &ldquo;0&rdquo;.</li></ol>
    <li>Initiative order begins with the player who has the lowest&ndash;numbered strategy card and proceeds to the player who has the strategy card that is next in numerical order.</li>
    <ol><li>Only strategy cards that were chosen during the strategy phase are used when determining initiative order; strategy cards not chosen during the strategy phase are ignored.</li></ol>
    <li>When playing with three or four players, a player&rsquo;s initiative is determined only by their lowest&ndash;numbered strategy card.</li>
    </ol>
