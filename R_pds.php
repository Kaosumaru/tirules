<p>A PDS (planetary defense system) is a structure that allows a player to defend their territory against invading forces.</p>
    <ol class="lrr">
    <li>Each PDS has the <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability.</li>
    <li>The primary way by which players acquire PDS units is by resolving either the primary or secondary ability of the <i>Construction</i> strategy card.</li>
    <li>A PDS unit is placed on a planet. Each planet can have a maximum of <b>two</b> PDS units.</li>
    <li>If a player&rsquo;s PDS is ever on a planet that does not contain any of their own ground forces and contains a unit that belongs to another player, that PDS is destroyed.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Notes</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>A PDS is both a structure and a unit.</li>
    <li>Each PDS also has the <sc>Planetary Shield</sc> ability.</li>
    </ol>
