<p>A component action is a type of action that a player can perform during their turn of an action phase.</p>
    <ol class="lrr">
    <li>Component actions can be found on various game components, including action cards, technology cards, leaders, exploration cards, relics, promissory notes, and faction sheets. Each component action is indicated by an &ldquo;Action&rdquo; header.</li>
    <li>To perform a component action, a player reads the action&rsquo;s text and follows the instructions as described.</li>
    <li>A component action cannot be performed if its ability cannot be completely resolved.</li>
    <li>If a component action is canceled, it does not use that player&rsquo;s action.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Notes</h1>
    <ol class="note">
