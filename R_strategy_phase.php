<p>During the strategy phase, each player chooses a strategy card to use during the round.</p>
<p>To resolve the strategy phase, players perform the following steps:</p>
    <ol class="lrr">
    <li><b>Step 1</b>: Starting with the speaker and proceeding clockwise, each player chooses one strategy card from the common play area and places it faceup in their play area.</li>
    <ol>
	    <li>If there are one or more trade good tokens on a strategy card when a player chooses it, that player gains those trade goods.</li>
    	<li>A player cannot choose a strategy card that another player has already chosen during the current strategy phase.</li>
    	<li>When playing with three or four players, each player will choose a second strategy card. After the last player has received their first strategy card, each player chooses a second strategy card, starting with the speaker and proceeding clockwise.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><b>Step 2</b>: The speaker places one trade good token from the supply on each strategy card that was not chosen.</li>
    <ol><li>During a four&ndash; or eight&ndash;player game, all strategy cards will be chosen, and therefore no trade good tokens will be placed on strategy cards.</li></ol>
    <p>Then, players proceed to the action phase.</p>
    </ol>

<h1>Notes</h1>

    </ol>
