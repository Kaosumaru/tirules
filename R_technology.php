<h1>Rules Reference</h1>
<style> .lrr > li:before, .lrr > h2 > li:before {content: '90.' counter(item, decimal);} </style>
<p>Technology cards allow players to upgrade units and acquire powerful abilities.</p>
    <ol class="lrr">
    <li>Each player places any technology they have gained faceup near their faction sheet. For the duration of the game, they <b>own</b> any technology cards they gain and can use the abilities on those cards.</li>
    <li>A player does not own any technology card that is in their technology deck.</li>
    <li>A player can gain a technology card from their technology deck by researching technology.</li>
    <ol><li>Both the primary and secondary abilities of the <i>Technology</i> strategy card allow a player to research a technology.</li></ol>
    <li>Any technology card that a player has not gained remains in their technology deck. A player can look through their technology deck at any time.</li>
    <li>If an ability instructs a player to <b>gain</b> a technology, they do not research it; they take it from their technology deck and place it in their play area, ignoring prerequisites.</li>
    <li>Some technologies are unit upgrades. Unit upgrades share a name with a unit that is printed on a player&rsquo;s faction sheet.</li>
    <ol><li>Players place any unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.</li></ol>
    <li>Each technology that is not a unit upgrade has a colored symbol displayed in the lower&ndash;right corner of the card and on its card back that indicates that technology&rsquo;s color.</li>
    <ol>
    	<li>A technology&rsquo;s color has no inherent game effect; however, each technology a player owns can satisfy a prerequisite of a matching color when researching other technology.</li>
    	<li>Unit upgrades do not have a color and do not satisfy prerequisites.</li>
    	<li>There are four colors of technologies. <code>See your rulebook for images.</code></li>
    </ol>
    <li>Most technology cards have a column of colored symbols displayed in the lower&ndash;left corner of the card. Each symbol in this column is a prerequisite.</li>
    <ol><li>A technology card&rsquo;s prerequisites indicate the number and color of technologies a player must own to research that technology card.</li></ol>
    <h2><li>Researching Technology</li></h2>
    <p>A player can research technology by resolving either the primary or secondary ability of the <i>Technology</i> strategy card during the action phase. Other game effects may also instruct a player to research technology.</p>
    <li>To research technology, a player gains that technology card from their technology deck and places it in their play area near their faction sheet.</li>
    <ol><li>Players place any unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.</li></ol>
    <li>A player cannot research a faction technology that does not match their faction.</li>
    <li>When researching technology, a player must satisfy each of a technology&rsquo;s prerequisites to research it. To satisfy a technology&rsquo;s prerequisites, that player must own one technology of the matching color for each prerequisite symbol on the technology card they wish to research.</li>
    <ol>
    	<li>Prerequisites symbols are displayed as symbols on the lower&ndash;left corner of the card.</li>
    	<li>Unit upgrade technologies do not have a color and do not satisfy prerequisites.</li>
    	<li>Players may use certain abilities or technology specialties to ignore some prerequisites.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><li>Technology Specialties</li></h2>
    <p>A technology specialty is a technology symbol found on some planets.</p>
    <li>When researching technology, a player can exhaust a planet they control that has a technology specialty to ignore one prerequisite symbol of the matching type on the technology card they are researching.</li>
    <li>If the planet card is already exhausted, it cannot be used to ignore a prerequisite.</li>
    <h2><li>Valefar Assimilator</li></h2>
    <p>The Nekro Virus faction can use its faction abilities in combination with its two <i>Valefar Assimilator</i> faction technologies to gain faction technologies that have been researched by other players, including unit upgrades.</p>
    <li>Basic units printed on faction sheets are not technologies and are not eligible targets for <i>Valefar Assimilator</i>.</li>
    <li>If a player becomes eliminated while one of their technologies has a Valefar Assimilator token on it, the Nekro Virus player places that technology in their play area; it is not removed from the game.</li>
    <li>If a Valefar Assimilator token is removed from the Saar <i>Floating Factory</i> unit upgrade, each of the Nekro Virus&rsquo; space docks must be placed on an eligible planet they control in that space dock&rsquo;s system, or the space dock is returned to their reinforcements.</li>
    <li>If a Valefar Assimilator token is removed from a war sun unit upgrade and the Nekro Virus player does not have the standard war sun unit upgrade, each of the Nekro Virus player&rsquo;s war suns are returned to their reinforcements.</li>
    <li>The Nekro Virus player may upgrade their units with units of the same type (e.g., &ldquo;dreadnought&rdquo; or &ldquo;infantry&rdquo;) even if those unit&rsquo;s names do not match. If the Nekro Virus gains a unit upgrade technology of the same unit type as a unit upgrade technology they already have, the previous upgrade is removed, and they must use the same Valefar Assimilator token that was used to copy the previous upgrade.</li>
    <li>When a Valefar Assimilator token is on a technology, that technology&rsquo;s color and type count toward objectives.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Notes</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If a player is instructed to research a technology by any game effect, that player must meet the prerequisites for the technology they research.</li>
    <li>If a player is instructed to gain a technology, that player does not have to meet the prerequisites, although most game effects that do this will specify what technologies may be gained by that effect.</li>
    <li>If a player is playing a faction with a faction&ndash;specific unit upgrade, they cannot research the generic upgrade for that unit type.</li>
